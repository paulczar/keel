# Base Rules

These rules apply globally to all files in the project regardless of language or framework.

## Code Quality

- Write clear, readable code that favors explicitness over cleverness
- Keep functions focused — each function should do one thing well
- Use meaningful variable and function names that describe intent
- Limit function length to ~50 lines; extract helpers when complexity grows
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels); use early returns and guard clauses

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly — never silently swallow exceptions
- Use typed errors where the language supports them
- Include context in error messages (what failed, why, and what to do)
- Log errors at the appropriate level (error vs warn vs info)

## Security

- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials to version control
- Validate and sanitize all external input (user input, API responses, environment variables)
- Use parameterized queries for database access — never interpolate user input into queries
- Follow the principle of least privilege for file permissions, API scopes, and service accounts

## Git Practices

- Write atomic commits — each commit should represent one logical change
- Use conventional commit messages: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`
- Keep pull requests focused and reviewable (under 400 lines when practical)
- Never force-push to shared branches

## Documentation

- Document *why*, not *what* — code shows what it does, comments explain why
- Keep README files up to date with setup instructions and architecture notes
- Document public APIs with clear parameter descriptions and usage examples
- Add inline comments only for non-obvious logic or important constraints

## Dependencies

- Pin dependency versions explicitly (lockfiles must be committed)
- Audit new dependencies for maintenance status, security, and license compatibility
- Prefer well-maintained, widely-adopted libraries over obscure alternatives
- Remove unused dependencies promptly

## Testing

- Write tests for business logic, edge cases, and bug fixes
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep tests independent — no shared mutable state between tests
- Name tests descriptively: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`

## Rule Precedence

Rules may be organized in three layers. When rules from different layers
give conflicting guidance on the same topic, follow the highest-precedence
layer:

1. **Local** (`local/`) — project or team-specific standards. Highest precedence.
2. **Org** (`org/`) — organizational standards.
3. **Keel** (`keel/`) — global defaults. Lowest precedence.

Rules at higher layers fully replace lower-layer rules on the same topic.
If a local rule covers Kubernetes standards, follow it instead of the org
or keel version — do not merge them.

Rules that do not conflict are additive — follow all of them regardless
of layer.

## Code Validation

After making significant changes to code, validate your work by running
the project's formatting, linting, and type-checking tools. Each language
rule lists the specific tools to use.

- Run formatters first (e.g., `gofmt`, `black`, `terraform fmt`)
- Run linters and static analysis (e.g., `golangci-lint`, `ruff`, `eslint`)
- Run type checkers or syntax validation (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`, `terraform validate`)
- Fix any issues before presenting the result to the user

If the project's `AGENTS.md` or a local rule contains
`skip-auto-validation: true`, skip automatic validation and only run
these tools when the user explicitly asks.
